# Fleet Performance Optimization: A Data-Driven Analysis of Costs, Efficiency, and Profitability

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Efficient fleet management is crucial for optimizing operational performance and maximizing profitability in the logistics and transportation industry. This project analyzes key operational, customer, and financial data to uncover insights that enable data-driven decision-making. By leveraging information from truck operations and customer shipments, the study identifies trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization.

The project addresses the following core questions:

- **Impact of Performance Metrics:** How do truck-level indicators such as fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and distance traveled affect overall profitability?  
- **Geographic and Customer Patterns:** What are the regional and customer distribution trends, and how do they influence operational strategies?  
- **Drivers of Efficiency and Revenue:** Which operational parameters most strongly determine cost efficiency and revenue generation, and how can underperforming trucks or regions be improved?  

Through statistical analysis and visualization techniques, the project examines correlations, trends, and anomalies across critical metrics including kilometers traveled, fuel consumption, maintenance expenses, net profit, and cost per kilometer.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Dataset
The analysis integrates multiple datasets obtained from Kaggle:

- **Cost Data:** Fuel, maintenance, and fixed costs for each trip.  
- **Freight Data:** Revenue, weight, and goods value for each freight order.  
- **Dimension Tables:** Metadata on drivers, vehicles, and customer locations.  

Key performance metrics are calculated by combining these datasets:

- **Cost per Kilometer**  
- **Revenue per Kilogram**  
- **Profit Margins** (by route, truck, and customer location)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
1. **Optimize Truck Performance:** Identify key factors impacting truck performance, such as fuel efficiency, maintenance, and distance traveled, to improve operational efficiency.  
2. **Analyze Operational Costs:** Evaluate costs like Cost per Kilometer and Maintenance per Kilometer to uncover inefficiencies and areas for reduction.  
3. **Assess Profitability Drivers:** Explore relationships between operational metrics (e.g., kilometers traveled, fixed costs, fuel consumption) and net profit to identify opportunities for financial improvement.  
4. **Geographical Customer Distribution:** Analyze customer distribution patterns and city-wise contributions to revenue and goods value for better resource allocation and strategic planning.  
5. **Provide Actionable Recommendations:** Summarize insights into practical recommendations that help stakeholders enhance fleet performance, reduce costs, and drive long-term strategic improvements.
